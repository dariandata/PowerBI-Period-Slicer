# PowerBI-Period-Slicer
This project was created to fulfill a user request: "I want a slicer to select custom time periods (last month, last 3 months, 6, 12, or 24 months, etc.)." While this might not be the most efficient solution for models in Import or Mixed mode, it works very well in DirectQuery mode, especially when you're limited to DAX-only calculated columns.
